# Internship Placement Analytics Dashboard (Synthetic Data)

A Power BI dashboard built using a synthetic dataset to explore internship placement trends, sourcing patterns, programme performance, and company engagement. Inspired by my real‑world experience working with internship operations, this project demonstrates how data storytelling can support decision‑making.
